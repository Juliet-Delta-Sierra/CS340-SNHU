Question: How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Answer: Throughout this project I have learned the importance of having code that is readble and easily understandable as this development went on for several weeks and I was having to refer back to variables, objects, and classes multiple times and the name and use cases needed to be clearly understood and easily understandable. I didn't really have time to think of the best options, I had to time to impelement code that made sense. The advantages of working with the Python CRUD file is that it is a "sole" source of information and when one thing is updated, it is all updated. Its a great way to keep code clean and able to be maintained easily.


Question: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Answer: I approached this from the viewpoint of delivering the customer what the customer expects. I looked at delivering this result through the process of using industry standard tools and choosing metircs that made sense for the use case. It was different for this project (as compared to other projects) because I had to deliver the weekly solution in a way that still met the overall objective of the final assignment. This process was easily understandable and it is very transferrable to other project where this customer deliverable is a requirement.


Question: What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Answer: Computer scientists look at the process and try to understand what elements make the process work and then try to understand how the component level elements can be better understood or used in a unique way to help answer other problems. This end result for this work would be benefitial as it is able to see what is happeneing with their process at a higher level. This end result is where the company can develop KPIs and this develop action plans to ensure the overall trends of their business are managed appropriately.
